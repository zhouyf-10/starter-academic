abstract: "Splitting control is the last resort of security control. By splitting the whole system into several isolated islands, splitting control can ensure system stability and power supply under extremely emergency situation. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based splitting strategy searching model is proposed. Connectivity constraints and voltage stability margin in each island are considered to help obtain more practical splitting strategy. The constraints are established in a linear form so that the model can be easily solved. Additionally, a strategy space reduction method based on flow tracing is presented to enhance computation efficiency. Case studies on four IEEE test systems shows the validity and computation performance of the proposed model. Also, the necessity of considering connectivity and stability is analyzed in simulation."
